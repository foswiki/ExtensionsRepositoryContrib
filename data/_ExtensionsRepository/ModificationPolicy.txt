---+ Modification Policy

One of CoordinateWithAuthor or PleaseFeelFreeToModify.

A special rule applies for Foswiki distributed default extensions which must follow a more strict process FollowsReleaseProcess.

This field was added to the PackageForm to provide a package author with a way to signal to co-developers what should be done about modifications.

Some extensions have effectively been abandoned, others in disuse but still others in constant update. 

Following the value for this field gives you safety in the knowledge that you had a right to make modifications to the subversion repository knowing that no-one will get upset by the fact that you did. (Actually, to date, no one has ever (publically) been upset by this happening...)
