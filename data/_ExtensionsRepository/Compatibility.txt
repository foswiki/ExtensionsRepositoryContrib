Compatibility of an extension can depend on many variables, including:
   * Which Foswiki version you are running n the server,
   * Which OS you are running on server and client,
   * Which other extensions you have installed,
   * Which versions of CPAN modules you have installed,
   * Which browsers are going to be used, and how they are configured,
The compatibility field of an extension cannot be taken as the final word on this subject; it is merely a set of guidelines that the extension author has used to indicate what has been tested, and indicate where there may be problems.
