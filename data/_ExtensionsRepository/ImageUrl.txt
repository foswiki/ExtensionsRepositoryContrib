The %TOPIC% field of the PackageForm provides a URL where an image for the extension can be found. The image will be used in the =configure= "Find Extensions" interface, and should be for the extension, and *not* for the company/project that provided the extension (though you may choose to incorporate corporate logos into the image, should your conscience and your corporate policies require it).

Images should be pre-scaled so that they aren't too big when displayed from within =configure=, and should be as square as possible, as they may be shrunk and forced to be square when they are thumbnailed.
